# üóÉÔ∏è Mantis Tracker - Database Schema

Mantis Tracker is an application that allows users to report and view mantis sightings on an interactive map. To store the data related to mantis sightings, the application uses a database that contains several tables.

The TblFundorte table stores information about the locations where mantis sightings have occurred. This information includes the postal code, city, street, country, district, and location description of the sighting. Each location is given a unique identifier (id) and its longitude and latitude are also recorded.

Each connection is given a unique identifier (id) and is linked to the TblMeldungen and TblUsers tables through foreign keys (id_meldung and id_user, respectively).

| Column     | Type    | Description                 |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| id         | Integer | Primary key                 |
